1. Scan this code or visit **https://8th.io/jini** on your mobile device (smart phone or tablet) to **verify if [8th wall](https://www.8thwall.com/) supports your mobile device**.  If the test demo works well, your device is supportive by 8th wall. If not, check the detailed listed requirement below to see if you could find another browser for alternative.

If your device does not support 8th wall, you will not be able to experience the application as the AR rendering is powered by it. However, you could still proceed to learn the application development process if you like. 
You could check [next chapter](/1.introduction/what-we-will-build) for exactly what we will build and learned via the workshop.
