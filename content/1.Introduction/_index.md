## Use Scenario 

This workshop will deliver an application for users to earn lucky money in red packets by AR scanning and share red packets with others, whose profit model is mobile online advertising.

There are two roles in this application, advertisers and users.

* The advertisers (such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, etc) would invest a certain amount of money in the Red Packet inventory with the purpose of promoting their products.

* Users can scan some symbols on physical objects to get a red packet, which contains a random amount of lucky money (2 USD for example) inside with the advertiser’s logo and name.

In the red packet distribution process, the application will select a advertiser to pay the lucky money, and post advertisements of the selected advertiser.
To get the lucky money, users can open the red packet and see the advertisement right after they get a red packet by AR scanning. 
In addition, we provide another option that can better promote advertisers' products and achieve viral marketing. In this option, users are encouraged to share the red packet with others (like friends, family) to get extra bonus. By such sharing, one red packet will be opened multiple times with corresponding advertisements being seen multiple times.

In real world, users can withdraw the money to their own bank accounts to get the real money from the red packets.
