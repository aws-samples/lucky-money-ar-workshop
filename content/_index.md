At [Lunar New Year]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year), it's tradition to give a [red packet(lucky money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) gift to your friends and family. There are filled with money, and symbolize good luck for the new year ahead. During the Lunar New Year, tens of billions of virtual red packets are sent over the Internet. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to add an Argumented Reality(AR) Red Packet feature to your application using Amazon Sumerian, AWS Amplify, Amazon Cognito, AWS AppSync and etc. 

At the end of this workshop, you will build an application for marketing promotion. With this application, you can scan a product(e.g. Coca Cola) to obtain some 'lucky money', and receive 'lucky money' from your friends.

Technically speaking, we will mainly learn the following aspects throughout the workshop.      

* Setting a Sumerian for AR interaction     
* Using Amplify to build application     
* Integrate Amplify with Sumerian
* Build CI/CD for modern applicaiton with AWS Amplify Console
