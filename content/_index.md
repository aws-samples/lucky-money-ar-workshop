As [spring festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year) (Chinese new year) is coming and Chinese tradition is to send [red packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) between families and friends with the blessing for good luck, 
we will design a red packet sharing application game in this workshop. 

Technically speaking, we will mainly learn the following aspects throughout the workshop.      

* Setting a Sumerian for AR interaction     
* Using Amplify to build application     
* Integrate Amplify with Sumerian
