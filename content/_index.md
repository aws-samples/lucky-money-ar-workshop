At [Lunar New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year), it's a tradition to give [Red Packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) as the gifts to your friends and family. There are filled with lucky money and is a symbol of blessings for good luck in the new year. 
As Internet has developed fast in the past few years, nowadays, comparing with cash, Chinese people prefer sending virtual red packets over the Internet during the Lunar New Year. Tens of billions of red packets are sent via this way every year.

In this workshop, you will learn how to add an Argumented Reality(AR) Red Packet feature to your application using Amazon Sumerian, AWS Amplify, Amazon Cognito, AWS AppSync and etc. 

At the end of this workshop, you will build an application that could be used for marketing promotion. With this application, you can scan a sponsor's product (e.g. Coca Cola) to obtain some lucky money, and receive lucky money from your friends.

Technically speaking, we will mainly learn the following aspects throughout the workshop.      

* Setting a Sumerian for AR interaction     
* Using Amplify to build application     
* Integrate Amplify with Sumerian
* Build CI/CD for modern applicaiton with AWS Amplify Console
